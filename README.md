# Wireless_Car
Created Wireless operated car using NodeMCU And android. I created this project to understand Wireless communication between sensors. Amazing project i had done. if you want source code of app as well as NodeMCU you can contact me on email dhruvgandhi75675@gmail.com. I had extended this project new addition of buzzer, led light and voice base command. Sample code is free of cost. additional code have some fix price for my hardwork.
